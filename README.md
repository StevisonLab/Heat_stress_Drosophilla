# Heat-Stress_Drosophila
## A comparison of thermal stress response between _Drosophila melanogaster_ and _Drosophila pseudoobscura_ reveals differences between species and sexes

### The project includes 3 different sections, Fecundity, Physiology, and Oogenesis development. The data associated with the entire project it is organized into separate subfolders:

### 1. [Fly husbandry and raw data for each section](https://github.com/StevisonLab/Heat_stress_Drosophilla/tree/main/rawdata)
### 2. [Analysis](https://github.com/StevisonLab/Heat_stress_Drosophilla/tree/main/scripts)
### 3. [Statistical results](https://github.com/StevisonLab/Heat_stress_Drosophilla/tree/main/Stats)

## The project includes a master script that will run the 3 analyses of the 3 different sections, but each can be run independently.
