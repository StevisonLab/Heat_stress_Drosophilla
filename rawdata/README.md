# Fly Stocks
## Temperature stress measurements were conducted using the wildtype inbred stock Canton-S (courtesy of Dr. Michelle Arbeitmen) of _D. melanogaster_, collected from Canton, Ohio, USA, and the wildtype stock MV2-25 (courtesy of Dr. Mohamed Noor) of _D. pseudoobscura_, collected from Mesa Verde, Colorado, USA. 

# Fly Husbandry and cross design
## All stocks of _D. melanogaster_ and _D. pseudoobscura_ were maintained at 25ºC and 20.5ºC, respectively with a photoperiod of 12:12 (light:dark) in incubators. Flies were reared on standard cornmeal-sugar-yeast-agar media in polypropylene enclosures. In each treatment group, 15 replicate crosses were set up with 15 flies approximately, in a 2:1, female-male ratio, aiming for ~3500 progeny per species. Parental flies were reared under control conditions and virgin females were collected and held at those conditions until reaching complete sexual maturity, 2 days for _D. melanogaster_ and 7 days for _D. pseudoobscura_. The highest non-lethal temperature for Canton-S _D. melanogaster_ where the flies were able to reproduce was 29.5ºC, which was selected for the high-temperature treatment. For the control treatment, the optimum temperature of 25ºC for _D. melanogaster_ and 20.5ºC for _D. pseudoobscura_ was used. The control temperature for _D. melanogaster_ was also used as the high temperature for _D. pseudoobscura_ to optimize the use of incubator space. F1 crosses were reared in high-temperature treatment conditions throughout development, 29.5 ºC and 25ºC for _D. melanogaster_ and _D. pseudoobscura_, respectively. These treatment temperatures allowed an increase in the temperature by 4.5 ºC above the optimal temperature for each species as a standard adjustment. Specifically, we opted to apply a constant temperature shift in each species, as opposed to the same specific temperature, because in nature they occupy different micro-habitats based on behavior and environmental preferences. While we cannot account for behavioral preference in a laboratory setting, we expect that the shifts in temperature of the micro-habitats due to global climate change would be to the same degree in both species. 

## After the F1 progeny of both species hatched from the pupal case, they were held under either treatment conditions for additional exposure as an adult (Egg + Larva + Pupa + Adult) or switched to the control temperature for developmental exposure only (Egg + Larva + Pupa). This resulted in a total of 4 treatment groups - (i) reared at control and kept in control (C-C), (ii) reared at control and switched to high temperature (C-H), (iii) reared in high temperature and switched to control (H-C), and (iv) reared in high temperature and kept in high temperature (H-H).
